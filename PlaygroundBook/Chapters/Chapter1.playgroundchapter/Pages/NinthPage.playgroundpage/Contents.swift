 #   Nice, you helped them!
 
 
 That is very good, and even if they are fictitious characters we are dealing with real situations, real people who are there in the world.
 
 Thinking about them from the beginning of the project is not to guard just against problems. It's making the experience that we're creating absolutely fantastic for everyone.
 Everyone has the right to have the best possible immersion in an app, so give it to them!
 
 ### That's all, folks! Thank you! */
